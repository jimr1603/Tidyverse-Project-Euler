# Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) has a series of
challenging coding problems. 

The first set of problems are over 20 years old - we're allowed to discuss
solutions to these out in the open. They respectfully ask that we don't discuss 
solutions of more recent puzzles.

I've put this book together to show how some of these puzzles can be solved
with R + tidyverse-style packages + other packages as useful, as well as offering
somewhere for R useRs to get some sensible Pull Requests in for #Hacktoberfest.
